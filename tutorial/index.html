    <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project shows how to use Play2, Akka and AngularJS
      for create a simple WebSocket based Timer application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic idea is to create a sort of roundtrip from 
      the user action to the response,
      using ajax calls for all the http requests and 
      a single WebSocket for all the responses.
      This is just an example, in a real world application 
      we need some more hacks to handle an high users number,
      and of course we need to write tests.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      When the user open the application,
      a WebSocket is associated with the userid,
      in that case,because this is an example, if user doesn't have an userId
      in session it is generated automatically and saved in session.
      (In Play the session is just a cookie, and there are some helpers to manage it)
    </p>
    <p>
      When user interact with the application clicking on one of the buttons, 
      through Angular an ajax call is sended to the server.
      The ajax call is handled by a Play Action, 
      this Action instead of send the result of the computation directly to te client, 
      send a message to the TimerActor and close straightaway 
      the http request send an Ok response.
      TimerActor handle the message,
      run its logic and send the operation response to the user through the associated WebSocket 
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach has two advantages : 
      <ul>
        <li>
          in case of long computation, we don't need to keep opened the http connection
        </li>
        <li>
          if the user has more then one window opened, all windows receive
          the same data, and maintain the same state.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Play Controller</h2>
    
    <p>
      The <a href="#code/app/controllers/AppController.scala" class="shortcut">Play controller</a> 
      has two main functionalities,
      the first is to create the WebSocket, and the second
      is to send the right message to the actor when an ajax call come in
    </p>
    <p>
      To create the socket, on the on the <code>withAuthWS</code> method 
      we call the function <code>WebSocket.async[JsValue] ()</code>
      which take a Future[(Iteratee[JsValue, Unit], Enumerator[JsValue])].
      This is generated from : 

<pre><code>(Iteratee.ignore[JsValue] mapDone {
_ =>
  timerActor ! SocketClosed(userId)
}, enumerator.asInstanceOf[Enumerator[JsValue]])</code></pre>

      The Itaretee ignore the input, and when the client close the connection send
      to the actor the message SocketClosed.
      The enumerator instead, is received from the TimerActor using the ask pattern : 

<pre><code>(timerActor ? StartSocket(userId)) map {
enumerator =>
}</code></pre>
    
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ajax handler Actions are trivial : 

<pre><code>
def start = withAuth {
userId => implicit request =>
  timerActor ! Start(userId)
  Ok("")
}</code></pre>

        <code>withAuth</code> provide a basic authentication,
        and after the function send a message to actor and send the Ok("")
        response to the client and close the http connection
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Actor</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="#code/app/actors/TimerActor.scala" class="shortcut">actor</a> manage the creation of channels 
        and the one to one relation between channels and users,
        and manage also the timer scheduler, increase the timer for
        active user and send the responses to users through the sockets,
        or better writing in the channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>case StartSocket(userId) =></code>
        When the message StartSocket come in,
        the actor get or create the channel for the current user

<pre><code>webSockets.get(userId) getOrElse {
  val broadcast: (Enumerator[JsValue], Channel[JsValue]) = Concurrent.broadcast[JsValue]
  UserChannel(userId, 0, broadcast._1, broadcast._2)
}</code></pre>

        The main method here is <code>Concurrent.broadcast[JsValue]</code>
        which create a tuple <code>(Enumerator[JsValue], Channel[JsValue])</code>
        This tuple is composed by an enumerator and the related channel, 
        when we'll write inside the channel through <code>channel.push()</code>
        method, the message is enumerated from the enumerator.
        So the as last operation for the message StartSocket,
        the actor send back to the sender, the AppController in that case,
        this enumerator which is user in the controller for create the socket
      </p>
      <p>
        The second interesting part in the actor is <code>case UpdateTime() =></code>
        The message UpdateTime is sended every second to the actor thanks the Akka helper
        <code>context.system.scheduler.schedule(0 second, 1 second, self, UpdateTime())</code>
        When this message come in, the actor update the time for every user in the list
        usersTimes, and write in the channel the current time
        <code>webSockets.get(userId).get.channel push Json.toJson(json)</code>
        and this message will be sended to the client from the socket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty trivial are the Start and Stop cases,
        the Stop case after removed the user from the usersTimes list,
        send also a message to the client with timer 0,
        for reset the timer label.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Angular</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut"></a>Angular controller is simple

<pre><code>$scope.start = ->
  $http.get(jsRoutes.controllers.AppController.start().url).success( -> )

$scope.stop = ->
  $http.get(jsRoutes.controllers.AppController.stop().url).success( -> )</code></pre>

        Start and stop menthods send a get to the Play action,
        using Play Js routes to create the right url.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the controller is initialized, 
        it create and connect a WebSocket

<pre><code>startWS = ->
  wsUrl = jsRoutes.controllers.AppController.indexWS().webSocketURL()

  $scope.socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl)
  $scope.socket.onmessage = (msg) ->
    $scope.$apply( ->
      console.log "received : #{msg}"
      $scope.time = JSON.parse(msg.data).data      
    )</code></pre>
     
        and every time a message come in, it write
        the content inside the controller model, 
        and the view is automatically updated from Angular.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Because we used WebSocket only for the server to client
        comunication, we can replace that with Server Sent Event
        and Comet polling.
        The actor which manage sockets and timers is 
        just a trivial example, 
        in a real project with thousands of users,
        we need to defer some cmputations to other actors.
